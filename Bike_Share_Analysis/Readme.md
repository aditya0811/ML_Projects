<p>
In this project, I performed an exploratory analysis on data provided by [Motivate]
(https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike-share system provider for many major cities in the United 
States. I compared the system usage between three large cities: New York City, Chicago, and 
Washington, DC.  

Also noted down the differences within each system for those users that are 
registered, regular users and those users that are short-term, casual users.

As files were pretty big ,I cannot upload all files ,but the file Sample.csv contains 1 rows 
initially (before converting into dictionary format) from each of the three cities files .

This is only a sampling of the data analysis process: from generating questions, wrangling the 
data, and to exploring the data.
